These are all the steps I had to take to get the code up and running on a new machine.  There may be more or less involved in this depending on what has already been installed on the machine in question.

1. Install git on your local machine
2. Follow the instructions on github to add your public rsa key and be able to pull
3. Set up git with you user name and email etc
4. clone the repo: git clone git@github/com/danturner/cj.git
5. clone Trilinos: git clone software.sandia.gov:/space/git/Trilinos
6. download and install netcdf
7. install hdf5 with macports
8. build netcdf with 
     ./configure --prefix=/home/ed/local --disable-netcdf-4
     make check install
   (folder permissions for tons of folders need to be updated to install)
9. Set the CJ_TRILINOS_DIR variable export CJ_TRILINOS_DIR="<>" in the do-trilinos-build script
10. copy the trilinos do-trininos-build file from the doc folder to SOME_BUILD_DIR
11. install mpicc in usr/local/bin (download mpich and install)
12. Install the latest version of xcode
13. install boost by following the directions on their website, (run ./bootstrap.sh and then ./b2)
14. configure trilinos with ccmake $TRINILOS_HOME (set this variable first)
15. Build trilinos with make and make install
16. You may need to get the SEACAS tools installed to run the regression tests
17. When installing SEACAS make sure that you set the group in the site.def file to a valid group
18. I've had a lot of trouble with installing SEACAS and most of it seems to be related to not having hdf5 or exodus installed in the right place (/usr/local/bin). Usually I can search for the file and put in the in right folder
